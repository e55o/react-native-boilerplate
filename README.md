All you need to do is to make sure you have android studio installed with `ADB`driver.

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/e55o/react-native-boilerplate.git
```

Then perform an 
```
npm install
```

after that run it for android/ios using
```
react-native run-android
```
OR
```
react-native run-ios
```

Make sure you connect your mobile device and set the `USB Debugging Mode` to ON, and your app will load on the phone
